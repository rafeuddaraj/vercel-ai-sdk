# AI App with Vercel AI SDK (Next.js 16)

A full-stack AI application built with **Next.js 16** and **JavaScript**, focused on learning and implementing the **Vercel AI SDK** in a real-world setup.

This project explores streaming AI responses, clean API design, and modern full-stack patterns.

## Overview

This app demonstrates how to integrate the Vercel AI SDK into a Next.js 16 project using plain JavaScript. The goal is to understand how AI streaming, server routes, and client rendering work together in production-ready apps.

## Features

- AI text generation with streaming responses
- App Router with Next.js 16
- JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Simple and readable API routes
- Fast, responsive UI
- Easy to extend with more AI features

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **AI:** Vercel AI SDK
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- A Vercel account
- API key for your AI provider

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
````

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Update this if you use a different provider supported by the Vercel AI SDK.

### Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
